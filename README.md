# AGMA SDK (iOS) Sample Apps

This repository contains examples of how to integrate the Agma SDK for iOS using [CocoaPods](/agma-sdk-ios-sampleapp-cocoapods/) as well as [SPM](/agma-sdk-ios-sampleapp-standalone-spm/).

If you're already using PrebidMobile, and would like to have a plug-and-play integration with your PrebidMobile SDK, please refer to [our fork of PrebidMobile on how to integrate it](https://github.com/agma-dna/prebid-mobile-ios/commit/bd568aee21f34afd440ac074e7d93d053b168ded).
